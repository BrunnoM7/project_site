# Simple site project
This website is a small study project built in the context of course in the platform [School of Net](https://www.schoolofnet.com/). The main objective of the project was to deliver a fully functional commercial web page for a Slacklike chat app and the layout for the application itself.

The main technologies and libraries used in this project were:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## How to run it?

Since this doesn't use any environment or require any webserver in order to run, you can just download the project to your local machine and run the **index.html** using your browser.
